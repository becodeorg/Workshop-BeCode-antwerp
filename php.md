## What is PHP?

- PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language. That means it is free!
- PHP scripts are executed on the server (backend), this is different than JavaScript (frontend)
- PHP is often used to connect with a database (often [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))

## PHP is an amazing and popular language!
- It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!
- It is deep enough to run the largest social network in the world (Facebook)!
- It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language! That would be you!

## Install it on your computer!
Installing PHP is easy to install with on a Windows pc with [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) or XAMPP(https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
