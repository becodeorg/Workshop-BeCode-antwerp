## What is PHP?

- PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language. That means it is free!
- PHP scripts are executed on the server (backend), this is different than JavaScript (frontend)
- PHP is often used to connect with a database (often [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))

## PHP is an amazing and popular language!
- It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system on the web (WordPress)!
- It is deep enough to run the largest social network in the world (Facebook)!
- It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language! That would be you!

## Install it on your computer!
Installing PHP is easy to install with on a Windows pc with [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
Not on windows? Ask the coach for advice!

## How to search for PHP documentation
PHP has very good documentation available on www.php.net. There is a nice trick you can use to quickly get documentation on any php function. Just type in the browser php.net/FUNCTION_NAME and you will arrive at the correct documentation page. Also spend some time clicking on the "See Also" section at the bottom of each page, this will quickly get you a good overview of what is possible with PHP.

## PHP the right way (advanced)
Another interesting read is https://phptherightway.com. This is not so much documentation over each separate function, but gives you more an overview of best practices and how different components work together.
